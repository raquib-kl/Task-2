# Plant Disease Detection System ðŸŒ¿

This repository implements a deep learning-based system to detect and classify plant leaf diseases. The project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on this System, providing a user-friendly solution for farmers and agricultural experts to identify diseases and improve crop yield effectively.


## Overview
Plant diseases significantly affect global agricultural output, making early detection crucial. This system uses image classification techniques to accurately identify diseases in plant leaves.

### Key Objectives:
- Detect diseases such as *Early Blight*, *Powdery Mildew*, *Leaf Spot*, and classify healthy leaves.
- Provide actionable insights to prevent disease spread.

## Features
- **Deep Learning Model**: Uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for image classification.
- **Transfer Learning**: Includes pretrained models like MobileNet and ResNet for better accuracy and efficiency.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed to integrate with mobile or web applications for ease of use.
